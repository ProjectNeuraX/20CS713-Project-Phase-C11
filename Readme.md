## Introduction

Speech recognition systems have traditionally relied on audio data for processing spoken language. However, LipNet represents a significant step towards the goal of understanding speech from visual cues, such as lip movements. This project introduces the LipNet model, which combines Convolutional 3D (Conv3D) layers and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layers to learn and predict speech phonemes directly from video data.

## Methodology

For a detailed explanation of LipNet's methodology, please refer to the [research paper](link-to-your-paper) associated with this project.
